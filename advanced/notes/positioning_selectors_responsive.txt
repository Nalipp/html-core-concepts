detailed positioning

	z-index / z-axis => allows you to control the order that elements stack on each other
		elements apear on the page according the order they apear on the DOM with elements apearing lower on the DOM gettig place on top of elements higher
		z-index allows you to control the stacking order regardless of the order on the DOM

		in order to use the z-index property, the element must have display: (relative, absolute, or fixed), same as with the box-offset properties
		the higher the z-index the more power it has to overlap lower elements
