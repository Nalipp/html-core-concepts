display
the box model

****************************************************************
display

	all elements have a display property
		most common (block, inline, inline-block, none
		block					=> takes up the entire available width and breaks into another line
		inline				=> only takes up space for the size of the element
		inline-block  => behaves as the block element but dosen't break into another line and has same styling rules as inline  


****************************************************************
the box model

	calculating the box size
		core		=> display property, element size, width / height values
		padding
		border
		margin

	the size of the box (width and height) is calculated using an additive approach

	
	manipulating the size of the box

	width
	  inline elements cannot have a specified width because they expand and contract according to the size of the contents
		only block and inline-block level elements can have a width value

	height
		inline height expands and contracts acording to the contents of the element
		only block and inline-block level elements can have a height value

	margin
		inline elements cannot have top and bottom margins 
		block and inline-block margins can have margin-top: and margin-bottom: properties

	padding
		is accepted by both block and inline level elements however it sometimes bleeds into the above or below elements
